# awesome-mysql

A curated list of awesome MySQL software, libraries and tools.

This list accepts and encourages Pull Requests. You may add:

- Categories
- Items

Categories & items must be added by alphabetical order (`utf8_general_ci`).
Conditions for adding a new item:

* If software, must be free and open source. Must have an acknowledged open source license. I'm not a lawyer, so I'll go with the
  FSF listings. Propriety, trial, shareware, halfway open sourced etc., will not be accepted, and will be removed.
* If software, must be reasonably recognized and adopted. Please do not add your newly created untested scripts.
* If software, the code must have been active in some production environment and must be in a reasonably GA quality.
* If software, the code must not be abandoned/discontinued.
* If software, only include one link and a one-liner description. Avoid superlatives, FUD and otherwise just stick to a reasonabel description.
* If software, do not include links to documentation. This is not an "awesome library" repository. We might go for that in the future.
* If e-book, must be free (as in free beer) and without commitment from the user (e.g. no requirement to enter personal details,
  no requirement to login with social network ID, etc.)
* Likewise, slides, videos, websites etc., must all be open to all and must not require payment nor credentials
* This is not the place for slides, videos or specific blog posts
